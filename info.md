- Used some examples provided by ST.
- Made sure I had correct license.
- Got a visible settings menu.
- My initial commits didn’t always reflect every change. I am learning, experimenting, and sometimes forgetting things in the process. Going forward, I’ll commit less frequently and hopefully label things more clearly.



This repository documents my learning process. I'm keeping early commits visible to show growth, not perfection.

Some commits may include AI-suggested comments or code. I’m learning as I go, and I’m trying to be transparent about that. Not everything will be perfect, but it’s mine, and I’m figuring it out one step at a time.
